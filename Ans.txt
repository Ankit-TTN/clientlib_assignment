Problem 2: How many requests are made when you embed a clientLib which itself has one dependency?
Ans There will be two request one for the dependency and one for the clientLib in which
    we are embedding the other clientLib.

Problem 3: Create 3 clientlibs. Embed clientlib3 in clientlib2 and clientlib2 in clientlib1.
           State the observation with respect to the number of calls and content of clientlib.
Ans: If we call clientLib1 in our code then there is one single network call for that and clientLib2 will we
     concatenated or added before the clienLib1.
     It is to be noted that the content from clientlib3 will not be embeded in this case.


    If we call clientLib2 in our code then again there will be a single network call and clientLib3 will we
    concatenated or added before the clienLib2.


    If we call both clientLib2 and clientLib1 then there will be two separte calls and result will similar to
    the above statement.
